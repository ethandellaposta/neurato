# Human Insights Directory

This directory stores `/humanify` outputs — human-readable insights extracted from your development sessions.

## Files

Insights are saved with the format:
`insights-YYYY-MM-DD-[session-topic].md`

## Purpose

- **Reinforce learning** — Review what you've actually learned
- **Build knowledge base** — Create a personal reference library
- **Track growth** — See how your understanding evolves
- **Share insights** — Pass knowledge to team members

## Usage

Run `/humanify` anytime you want to:
- Extract insights from completed work
- Understand patterns you're using
- Get reinforcement suggestions
- Create human-readable documentation

## Integration

- Use before `/end-session` to capture learning
- Use after complex features or debugging
- Use weekly to review learning patterns
- Add to your personal knowledge management system

## Git Considerations

These files contain your personal learning insights. Consider:
- Adding to git if sharing with team
- Keeping private if personal notes
- Using `.gitignore` for sensitive insights
