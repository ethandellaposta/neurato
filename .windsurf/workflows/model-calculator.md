# Model Cost Calculator

## Model Data from Your Screenshot

| Model | Multiplier | Credits | Cost | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|----------|
| GPT-5.2 Low Thinking | 1x | 0 | FREE | Simple tasks |
| GPT-5.2 Low Thinking Fast | 2x | 0 | FREE | Quick simple tasks |
| GPT-5.2 Medium Thinking | 2x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Standard work |
| GPT-5.2 Medium Thinking Fast | 4x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Fast standard work |
| GPT-5.2 High Thinking | 6x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Complex tasks |
| GPT-5.2 High Thinking Fast | 6x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Fast complex tasks |
| GPT-5.2 XHigh Thinking | 8x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Expert tasks |
| GPT-5.2 XHigh Thinking Fast | 16x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Maximum power |
| GPT-5.2-Codex High | 2x | 2 | ~$0.06 | Code specialized |

## Optimization Strategy

### Zero-Cost Tier (FREE)
- **Low Thinking** - Basic tasks
- **Low Thinking Fast** - Quick basic tasks
- **Strategy**: Use for 80% of work

### Standard Tier (~$0.06)
- **Medium Thinking** - Standard complexity
- **Medium Thinking Fast** - Faster standard
- **High Thinking** - Complex work
- **Strategy**: Use for multi-file or judgment tasks

### Power Tier (~$0.06)
- **XHigh Thinking** - Expert level
- **XHigh Thinking Fast** - Maximum power (16x!)
- **Strategy**: Use for architecture, critical decisions

### Specialized (~$0.06)
- **Codex High** - Code-focused tasks
- **Strategy**: Use for pure coding challenges

## Exponential Power Extraction

### The 16x Multiplier Secret

Your **XHigh Thinking Fast** model at 16x multiplier with the same 2 credits as Medium Thinking gives you:

**8x more power per credit** than standard models!

Techniques to maximize this:
1. **Batch complex tasks** - Get 16x the work in one prompt
2. **Ask for complete systems** - Architecture + implementation + tests
3. **Use for debugging** - 16x reasoning power finds bugs faster
4. **Future-proofing** - Consider scaling, security, performance

### Example: Extracting 16x Value

```
Don't: "Fix this bug" (wastes 16x power)
Do: "Analyze this entire module, find all potential bugs,
     suggest architectural improvements, and provide
     refactored code with tests. Consider performance
     and security implications."
```

## Budget Planning

### Free User (500 credits/month):
- **Zero-cost approach**: 250 Low Thinking tasks = FREE
- **Power approach**: 250 XHigh Fast tasks = $15/month
- **Hybrid approach**: 200 Low + 50 XHigh Fast = $3/month

### Pro User Optimization:
- **80% Low Thinking** = 400 prompts = FREE
- **20% XHigh Fast** = 100 prompts = $6/month
- **Total**: $6/month for 16x power on critical tasks

## Dynamic Model Selection

Since I can't scrape your UI directly, here's how to track:

1. **Manual tracking** - Note which model you're using
2. **Credit monitoring** - Watch the scoreboard
3. **Task classification** - Match task to model tier
4. **ROI analysis** - Was the upgrade worth it?

## Building Your Own API

To make this dynamic, you could:

1. **Create a config file** (we did - `.max/models.json`)
2. **Build a simple script** to read current model
3. **Track usage** in a spreadsheet or database
4. **Automate optimization** based on patterns

Would you like me to:
- Create a usage tracking script
- Build a model recommendation engine
- Design a credit optimization dashboard
- Something else?
